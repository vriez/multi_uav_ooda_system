The failure of a UAV during mission execution creates an immediate resource allocation challenge: reassigning orphaned tasks to operational vehicles while respecting battery limitations, payload capacity, and regulatory constraints that academic research often ignores. This work develops a fault-tolerant control system for multi-UAV fleets that addresses this challenge under realistic operational conditions.

The system applies Boyd's OODA loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) to transform vehicle failures into recoverable events. Upon detecting a fault, the system evaluates remaining fleet capacity, prioritizes orphaned tasks, and reallocates them to healthy vehicles while enforcing safety margins. When physical or regulatory limitations make full recovery impossible, the system escalates to human operators with quantified impact assessments rather than forcing unsafe autonomous decisions.

Three technical contributions emerge from this work: a resource-aware reallocation algorithm that jointly considers battery reserves, payload limits, and collision avoidance; a priority-based partial coverage strategy that gracefully degrades mission objectives when complete recovery is infeasible; and an intelligent escalation framework that distinguishes compensable failures from those requiring human judgment.

Experimental validation demonstrates adaptation times of 0.2-1.2 milliseconds for the complete OODA cycle---nearly four orders of magnitude faster than the design target---with complete task recovery in surveillance and search-and-rescue scenarios. In time-critical applications, this speed advantage translates to preserved lives during the golden hour. The approach prioritizes honest performance over inflated claims: acknowledging what autonomous systems cannot do proves as valuable as demonstrating what they can.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{The Reality Gap in Multi-Agent UAV Research}

Multi-UAV coordination has emerged as a key enabler of scalable autonomy in logistics, environmental monitoring, and emergency response. Yet much fault-tolerant multi-agent research still operates within idealized boundaries (ZHANG; JIANG, 2008; YU; JIANG, 2015), presuming unlimited energy, unrestricted payload capacity, instantaneous communication, and fully autonomous decision authority—assumptions that mask real-world complexities.

In practice, UAV operations face strict physical and regulatory limits: batteries must retain 10–20\% safety reserves, payloads deplete irreversibly mid-mission, communication links introduce latencies up to two seconds, and beyond visual line of sight operations require constant operator supervision. The resulting ``reality gap'' means systems reliable in laboratory conditions may struggle in the field. Closing this gap requires architectures that adapt to uncertainty and resource constraints while maintaining situational awareness and regulatory compliance.

\section{The OODA Loop: From Combat Theory to Autonomous Resilience}

The OODA loop—Observe, Orient, Decide, Act—originated from Colonel John Boyd's studies of aerial combat dynamics (BOYD, 1987), proposing that success depends on processing information and adapting faster than adversaries. For autonomous systems, it provides a recursive cycle: ``Observe'' collects sensor and telemetry data; ``Orient'' establishes situational awareness; ``Decide'' selects actions under constraints; and ``Act'' executes decisions while feeding outcomes back into subsequent observations.

Applied to UAV fleets, OODA extends beyond traditional feedback control by integrating situational reasoning with awareness of resource states, communication health, and mission progress. Most existing coordination systems emphasize either rapid reaction or long-term planning, but rarely both (BALA et al., 2025).

\section{Bridging the Gap: OODA-Based Fault-Tolerant Mission Control}

Despite its theoretical appeal, the OODA framework has rarely been implemented as a real-time operational control system for UAV fleets. Most prior work either focuses on single-vehicle fault recovery (MUELLER; D'ANDREA, 2014; SUN et al., 2022) or treats multi-agent coordination under ideal conditions with unlimited resources (LI et al., 2017; YANG et al., 2011). Architectures for fault-tolerant multi-robot cooperation such as ALLIANCE (PARKER, 1998) have demonstrated resilience principles, but few systems integrate real-world resource constraints, probabilistic fault detection, and operator-in-the-loop supervision within a unified architecture.

This research addresses that gap through the development of a hybrid OODA-based fault-tolerant mission control system designed for real-time UAV fleet management. The system operates as a hybrid finite-state machine (FSM) that continuously cycles between monitoring and adaptation modes, combining deterministic state transitions with probabilistic failure identification to maintain robust mission execution under realistic constraints.

\section{System Overview and Contributions}

\subsection{Hybrid OODA–FSM Architecture}

At its core, the system functions as a hybrid finite-state controller implementing continuous monitoring at 2 Hz and invoking the OODA cycle upon failure detection. Deterministic state logic ensures predictable mission flow, while probabilistic reasoning handles uncertain or delayed telemetry data.

\subsection{Real-Time Failure Detection}

The system implements multi-modal failure detection through 2 Hz telemetry polling, feeding three detection pathways: communication timeout alerts for telemetry gaps exceeding 1.5 seconds, explicit fault codes from onboard diagnostics, and statistical anomaly detection for subtle degradation patterns (battery discharge >5\%/30s, position jumps >100m, altitude violations). This fusion achieves sub-second fault identification while minimizing false positives.

\subsection{OODA Execution for Fault Recovery}

Upon fault detection, the system executes a structured OODA cycle completing in 4 to 5.5 seconds. The \textbf{Observe} phase (1.0–1.5s) aggregates fleet telemetry and quantifies mission impact. The \textbf{Orient} phase (1.0–1.5s) evaluates remaining capacity—battery reserves, payload availability, temporal constraints—and re-prioritizes orphaned tasks. The \textbf{Decide} phase (1.0–1.5s) classifies feasibility: full reallocation when >75\% of tasks are recoverable, partial reallocation for 50–75\%, or operator escalation below 50\%. The \textbf{Act} phase (0.5–1.5s) dispatches commands and updates the operator dashboard.

\subsection{Constraint-Aware Strategy Layer}

The three recovery strategies represent fundamentally different operational philosophies, each tailored to the severity and characteristics of the failure scenario.

\textbf{Full Reallocation} engages when the fleet retains sufficient capacity to absorb all orphaned tasks. The system executes a constraint-aware optimization routine (detailed in Algorithm 2) that integrates new waypoints into existing flight plans while minimizing total travel distance through heuristic TSP solutions. This strategy maximizes mission completion without operator intervention, treating the failure as a temporary disruption rather than a mission-altering event.

\textbf{Partial Reallocation} acknowledges resource limitations honestly. When complete recovery proves impossible, the system prioritizes tasks exceeding a 0.7 priority threshold—ensuring that mission-critical objectives receive available resources while lower-priority tasks are deferred or abandoned. Crucially, the system issues explicit coverage-gap alerts quantifying the impact: operators receive not merely notification that tasks were dropped, but precise metrics on what percentage of the mission objective remains achievable.

\textbf{Operator Escalation} activates when autonomous decision-making would produce unacceptable outcomes. Rather than forcing a poor solution, the system initiates a supervised decision protocol, presenting the operator with contextualized options: deploying reserve UAVs, extending mission timelines, accepting degraded coverage, or executing a controlled mission abort. A 30-second countdown ensures timely human response while providing an automatic failsafe—if no operator input arrives, the system defaults to the safest available action, preserving vehicle integrity over mission completion.

\subsection{Performance and Scalability}

The complete OODA cycle achieves reaction times between 4 and 5.5 seconds under realistic communication latency conditions. Computationally, the system scales linearly with fleet size for monitoring and resource evaluation, and quadratically for collision avoidance checks—supporting real-time performance for up to 12 UAVs without exceeding sub-6-second response thresholds.

\section{Summary}

By grounding UAV mission control in the OODA decision cycle, this research introduces a system capable of adaptive, explainable, and regulatorily compliant autonomy. The framework unites rapid machine-driven response with human-supervised oversight, offering a practical balance between safety and autonomy.

In doing so, it bridges the long-standing gap between theoretical multi-agent fault tolerance and real-world deployability—demonstrating that reactive, resource-aware autonomy is not merely a conceptual goal, but an achievable engineering reality for the next generation of UAV fleet operations.

\chapter{System Architecture}

\section{Centralized OODA Architecture with Distributed Execution}

The system implements a hierarchical control structure in which the Ground Control Station hosts the OODA Loop Engine for centralized decision-making while UAVs execute tasks with operational autonomy. This architecture balances the optimization advantages of global fleet visibility against the responsiveness requirements of distributed execution, a design choice grounded in both regulatory constraints and practical deployment considerations. Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} presents a comprehensive overview of this layered architecture, illustrating the information flow between the GCS decision engine, the communication infrastructure, and the distributed UAV fleet. The diagram delineates the separation of concerns between centralized planning---where the OODA loop processes fleet-wide telemetry to generate optimal task allocations---and decentralized execution, where individual vehicles maintain local autonomy for navigation and immediate obstacle avoidance.

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio]{images/architecture.png}
    \caption{Architecture Overview}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Design Rationale and Trade-offs}

The centralized OODA architecture derives from convergent factors: regulatory compliance for Beyond Visual Line of Sight operations mandates operator oversight, global fleet visibility enables superior optimization compared to distributed consensus, and single-point decision-making eliminates complex inter-UAV coordination protocols. The hybrid autonomy model explicitly recognizes scenarios where complete failure compensation proves physically impossible, maintaining safety through human-in-the-loop oversight while prioritizing honest performance assessment over aspirational capabilities.

Architectural trade-offs require mitigation. The GCS single point of failure is addressed through autonomous Return-to-Launch behaviors triggered by communication timeout. Communication bandwidth scales linearly with fleet size, though 2 Hz telemetry maintains manageable overhead for fleets up to twelve UAVs. The bidirectional architecture exhibits asymmetric data flow: telemetry uplink packets (~2 KB) exceed command downlink packets (~1 KB), reflecting the richer state information transmitted from UAVs compared to the compact waypoint commands dispatched by the GCS.

The 2 Hz telemetry rate reflects practical deployment constraints rather than simulation convenience. Commercial systems typically employ 1-2 Hz rates; higher frequencies increase bandwidth requirements and packet collision probability without proportional benefit given the 3-6 second OODA response latency. This conservative choice ensures field deployability while maintaining responsive fault detection, contrasting with prior simulation work that assumes instantaneous communication.

\section{OODA Loop Execution Flow}

The OODA loop implements continuous monitoring and reactive decision-making through four sequential phases. \textbf{Statistical validation (N=30 runs per scenario) demonstrates algorithmic computation times of 0.1--0.9 ms (mean) for the complete OODA cycle}, with 95\% confidence intervals confirming sub-millisecond performance. This ensures that algorithmic processing never becomes the system bottleneck, leaving the 4-6 second end-to-end response budget available for communication latency and command verification.

\subsection{Computation Time vs. End-to-End System Latency}

An important distinction exists between \textbf{OODA algorithm computation time} and \textbf{total system response latency}. The original 4-6 second design target specified end-to-end response time including communication; the sub-millisecond measurements represent pure algorithmic computation. These are complementary metrics, not a discrepancy:

\textbf{OODA computation time (measured):} The complete OODA cycle---encompassing all four phases (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) with failure detection logic, capacity analysis, constraint validation, and reallocation optimization---executes in 0.2 to 1.2 milliseconds end-to-end. Within this cycle, the core greedy allocation algorithm (Algorithm 2) executes in 0.1-0.3 ms. This represents pure computational processing measured in software-in-the-loop simulation without network delays. The sub-millisecond execution validates that algorithmic complexity remains tractable for real-time deployment.

\textbf{End-to-end system latency (design target):} The original 4-6 second estimate accounts for complete system response including bidirectional RF communication delays, a critical factor in distributed UAV coordination (ABDESSAMEUD; TAYEBI, 2011; IZADI; GORDON; ZHANG, 2009). This encompasses 0.5-1.0 seconds uplink for failure notification, 0.5-1.0 seconds downlink for command dispatch, telemetry aggregation latency at 2 Hz sampling intervals (up to 0.5 seconds), and command acknowledgment verification (0.2 seconds). In field deployment with long-range radio links, total adaptation time spans:

\begin{equation}
T_{total} = T_{uplink} + T_{compute} + T_{downlink} + T_{ack} \approx 1.0 + 0.001 + 1.0 + 0.2 = 2.2 \text{ seconds}
\end{equation}

This 2-3 second end-to-end response remains substantially faster than the 4-6 second initial conservative estimate, with the primary time consumption attributable to RF propagation delays rather than computational bottlenecks. The millisecond-scale algorithmic performance ensures that computation never becomes the limiting factor, even for larger fleet sizes where complexity increases.

\textbf{Practical implication:} Real-world deployments will experience 2-3 second adaptation times dominated by communication latency, not the sub-millisecond algorithmic computation. This distinction matters for system design---network optimization provides greater latency reduction potential than further algorithmic speedup. The 2-3 second end-to-end response validates the OODA approach for time-critical applications such as search and rescue operations, where rapid fault recovery directly impacts mission success.

Figure~\ref{fig:ooda_loop} illustrates the complete OODA loop execution flow, depicting the cyclical progression through Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act phases. The diagram emphasizes the continuous nature of this adaptive process: each Act phase conclusion feeds telemetry back into the subsequent Observe phase, creating an unbroken feedback loop that maintains situational awareness throughout mission execution. This visual representation clarifies how failure events trigger immediate cycle activation, with each phase contributing specific analytical or executive functions toward recovery.

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio]{images/ooda_loop.png}
    \caption{OODA Loop Execution Flow}
    \label{fig:ooda_loop}
\end{figure}

\subsection{OBSERVE Phase: Failure Detection and State Aggregation}

The OBSERVE phase (1.0-1.5s budget) establishes situational awareness through multi-modal failure detection: timeout detection for telemetry gaps >1.5s, explicit fault messages from UAV systems, and statistical anomaly detection (battery discharge >5\%/30s, position jumps >100m, altitude violations). \textit{Note: Computation executes in microseconds; time budget accommodates 2 Hz RF telemetry aggregation.} Upon failure confirmation, the system aggregates fleet state from all operational UAVs, identifies failed vehicle last-known state, enumerates lost tasks with priorities and deadlines, and calculates mission impact percentage.

\subsection{ORIENT Phase: Situation Assessment and Capacity Analysis}

The ORIENT phase (1.0-1.5s budget) transforms observations into actionable intelligence, drawing on coverage control theory for mobile sensing networks (CORTÉS et al., 2004; SCHWAGER; RUS; SLOTINE, 2009). Mission impact evaluation quantifies coverage loss, affected zones, and deadline pressure. Fleet capacity analysis inventories spare resources: battery capacity (subtracting committed energy and 15-20\% safety reserves, yielding ~3min flight per 10\% spare), payload capacity for delivery missions, and temporal margins relative to deadlines. Task prioritization applies Algorithm 1 to generate 0-1 priority scores from temporal urgency, mission criticality, and spatial cost. Feasibility classification: feasible (>75\% tasks reallocable, >90\% completion), partial (50-75\% reallocable, 75-90\% completion), or infeasible (<50\% reallocable, <75\% completion).

\subsection{DECIDE Phase: Strategic Planning and Algorithmic Optimization}

The DECIDE phase (1.0-1.5s budget) selects strategies via three-tier hierarchy. \textbf{Full Reallocation:} Executes Algorithm 2 for constraint-aware assignment to nearest UAVs with collision avoidance, optimizing path integration for 90-100\% completion. \textbf{Partial Reallocation:} Filters tasks with priority >0.7, allocates high-priority tasks first, generates coverage gap alerts with operator recommendations for 75-90\% completion. \textbf{Operator Escalation:} Generates critical alerts (urgency: high if coverage <50\% or critical tasks lost, medium if 50-75\%, low if >75\%), presents alternatives (backup UAV, mission abort, degraded coverage), implements 30s countdown timer with automatic safe-default execution.

\subsection{ACT Phase: Command Execution and System Update}

The ACT phase (0.5-1.5s budget) dispatches mission updates to affected UAVs (new waypoints, task assignments, collision parameters) via 2 Hz uplink with 200ms acknowledgment verification and 3-attempt retry logic. Dashboard updates display fleet status, mission progress, coverage heatmaps, and alerts. Performance logging captures failure details, phase durations, reallocation results, and escalation status. Following completion, the system returns to continuous 2 Hz monitoring, supporting cascading failure handling through iterative OODA cycles.

\section{Sequential Constraint Validation Process}

The constraint validation process implements fail-fast sequential checking that prioritizes constraints by criticality and commonality, enabling early termination when fundamental limitations preclude autonomous compensation while avoiding wasted computation on infeasible scenarios. Figure~\ref{fig:constraints} presents the decision flowchart governing this sequential validation, illustrating how each constraint category serves as a gate that must be passed before subsequent checks proceed. The hierarchical ordering---battery constraints first, followed by payload verification, and concluding with temporal feasibility---reflects both the relative criticality of each constraint type and the computational efficiency of early rejection when fundamental physical limitations cannot be satisfied.

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio]{images/constraints_checking.png}
    \caption{Constraint Checking Process}
    \label{fig:constraints}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Battery Constraint Verification}

Battery constraint evaluation serves as the primary validation gate due to its status as the most common limiting factor and safety-critical nature. For each lost task, the system calculates Euclidean distance from candidate UAVs, determines required battery percentage via vehicle-specific efficiency factors, and computes spare capacity as current charge minus committed energy and 15--20\% safety reserves. Pass: every lost task finds one candidate UAV within spare capacity. Fail: any task unreachable by all UAVs without violating safety margins, triggering immediate operator escalation. Prioritization derives from catastrophic failure risk and computational efficiency of distance-based evaluation.

\subsection{Payload Constraint Verification}

Payload constraint evaluation (conducted conditionally upon battery satisfaction) applies exclusively to cargo-carrying operations. The system calculates spare payload as maximum capacity minus current load, requiring task payload not exceed available spare capacity. Pass: all payload-requiring tasks find adequate capacity. Fail: removes payload-heavy tasks from consideration while reallocating feasible tasks, producing partial coverage. Payload constraints represent hard physical limits—mid-air transfers remain impossible, constraining reallocation to base station cargo swaps to avoid structural failure or flight instability.

\subsection{Time Constraint Verification}

Time constraint evaluation (positioned as final validation) verifies reallocated tasks achieve completion before deadline expiration via cumulative time calculation: transit time + task execution + current task remainder. Pass: yields feasible classification with 90--100\% completion plans. Fail: produces partial reallocation prioritizing by deadline urgency, accepting delays for low-priority tasks with 75--90\% completion projections. Final positioning reflects maximum flexibility—violations produce mission degradation rather than safety risks, unlike battery/payload constraints.

\subsection{Design Rationale}

Sequential checking provides: (1) early exit efficiency, saving ~60\% computation when battery constraints fail; (2) clear failure attribution for precise diagnostics and operator understanding; (3) prioritized ordering checking safety-critical battery bottlenecks first, physical payload limits second, flexible time constraints last.

\section{Communication Sequence and Information Flow}

The temporal communication sequence and information pipeline architecture demonstrate the system's end-to-end fault response capability, transforming raw sensor measurements into executable commands through systematic OODA processing.

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio]{images/sequence_diagram.png}
    \caption{Mission Execution Sequence}
    \label{fig:sequence}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Temporal Execution Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:sequence} illustrates communication flow during failure events with precise timing. At reference time T, a UAV experiences failure, transmitting a high-priority fault message with 0.4-1.0 second latency. The OBSERVE phase confirms the fault and aggregates fleet state by T+1.5 seconds. The ORIENT phase completes impact assessment and capacity analysis by T+2.5 seconds. The DECIDE phase generates reallocation plans by T+3.5 seconds. The ACT phase dispatches commands and updates dashboards by T+4.0 seconds, establishing a 4-second response timeline from failure detection to command dispatch.

This temporal progression demonstrates responsive fault recovery while accommodating realistic communication latencies inherent in long-range RF links. The explicit timing breakdown provides quantitative performance baselines for fault-tolerant mission adaptation.

\subsection{Information Pipeline Architecture}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/processing_pipeline.png}
\caption{Data Flow Pipeline}
\label{fig:pipeline}
\end{figure}

The data flow architecture, depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}, implements unidirectional information transformation with clear phase boundaries. The input layer ingests dual streams: high-frequency telemetry from UAV sensors updated at 2 Hz, and static mission definitions loaded at initialization. The processing layer transforms these inputs sequentially—OBSERVE produces fleet states and failure lists, ORIENT generates impact assessments and capacity analyses, DECIDE creates strategies and command packets, and ACT executes commands while logging performance metrics. The output layer distributes results through three channels: commands transmitted to UAVs, alerts displayed to operators, and logs persisted for post-mission analysis.

This unidirectional flow pattern provides clear data provenance enabling traceability, testability through phase isolation with mock input capability, and maintainability where phase modifications avoid backward ripple effects. The implicit feedback loop manifests as ACT phase commands update UAV operational states, with updated telemetry reflecting new states flowing back into OBSERVE phase in subsequent cycles.

\subsection{Scalability Considerations}

Computational complexity analysis reveals scaling characteristics across OODA phases. The OBSERVE phase scales linearly with fleet size through increased telemetry aggregation. The ORIENT phase maintains linear scaling for capacity calculations across vehicles. The DECIDE phase exhibits O(N$\times$M) complexity for task allocation across N UAVs and M tasks, with collision avoidance scaling quadratically O(N$^2$) for pairwise path verification. These complexity characteristics yield expected OODA execution times of 5-6 seconds for twelve-UAV fleets and 8-10 seconds for twenty-UAV fleets, potentially exceeding acceptable response thresholds for larger deployments.

\section{Scenario-Specific Adaptations}

The architecture demonstrates flexibility across diverse mission profiles through scenario-specific workflow patterns while maintaining consistent OODA loop mechanics. Three representative mission types illustrate architectural adaptation to varying operational requirements and constraint priorities, as depicted in Figures~\ref{fig:surveillance}, \ref{fig:sar}, and~\ref{fig:delivery}.

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio]{images/surveillance_loop.png}
    \caption{Surveillance Mission OODA Workflow}
    \label{fig:surveillance}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Surveillance missions} (Figure~\ref{fig:surveillance}) emphasize continuous area coverage through patrol patterns with failures requiring coverage gap minimization and critical zone protection. The workflow depicts a 120m $\times$ 120m perimeter divided into 9 patrol zones (40m $\times$ 40m each) monitored by 6 UAVs with 30-minute endurance. Task characteristics include waypoint-based patrol routes, priority differentials between critical security zones ($P=0.9$ for top row) and routine patrol areas ($P=0.4$ for bottom row), and deadline constraints for periodic revisit frequencies. Constraint considerations focus primarily on battery limitations affecting patrol duration and spatial coverage range, with time constraints enforcing revisit deadlines for critical areas. When UAV-3 experiences battery anomaly (8\% vs.\ expected 55\%), the OODA cycle detects the failure, evaluates spare capacity in adjacent UAVs (UAV-2: 15\%, UAV-4: 12\%), and executes a split-zone reallocation strategy---Zone 5 divides between UAV-2 and UAV-4, achieving 100\% coverage recovery with 91.7\% surveillance quality in 0.7 milliseconds. Target performance maintains 90-100 percent coverage through reallocation prioritizing critical zones.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio]{images/sar_loop.png}
    \caption{Search and Rescue Mission OODA Workflow}
    \label{fig:sar}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Search and rescue missions} (Figure~\ref{fig:sar}) emphasize time-critical area coverage through systematic grid search patterns with failures requiring rapid reallocation to maintain search efficiency. The workflow illustrates a 120m $\times$ 120m search area with 9 zones searched by 4 thermal-equipped UAVs under golden hour constraints. Zone priorities reflect distance from last known position (LKP): $P=0.9$ for the top row (closest to LKP), $P=0.6$ for the middle row (travel corridors), and $P=0.4$ for the bottom row (remote areas). Task characteristics include grid cell assignments with systematic coverage requirements and stringent deadline constraints reflecting survivor time sensitivity. Battery and time constraints dominate feasibility assessment. When UAV-2 loses GPS signal in a ravine, the system reallocates Zone 3 (HIGH priority) to UAV-1 and Zone 4 (MEDIUM priority) to UAV-3, achieving 100\% coverage recovery in 1.2 milliseconds while consuming only 0.00003\% of the golden hour window. Target performance accepts 75-90 percent coverage as acceptable degradation when full compensation proves infeasible, acknowledging that incomplete coverage in time-critical scenarios exceeds mission abortion alternatives.

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=0.9\textheight, keepaspectratio]{images/delivery_loop.png}
    \caption{Delivery Mission OODA Workflow}
    \label{fig:delivery}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Delivery missions} (Figure~\ref{fig:delivery}) emphasize reliable cargo transport to designated destinations with failures requiring payload-aware reallocation and potential return-to-base cargo swaps when reallocation proves infeasible. The workflow depicts a heterogeneous 3-UAV fleet---UAV-1 (heavy lifter, 1.0 kg capacity), UAV-2 and UAV-3 (standard, 0.5 kg capacity each)---delivering 5 packages ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 kg. Task characteristics include point-to-point delivery routes with specific destination coordinates, payload weight requirements varying per package, and deadline constraints for time-sensitive deliveries. Payload constraints assume critical importance alongside battery limitations. When UAV-1 experiences battery anomaly while carrying Packages A and B (0.9 kg total), the system evaluates reallocation feasibility: Package B (0.4 kg) exceeds all available spare capacity (UAV-2: 0.05 kg spare, UAV-3: 0.15 kg spare), triggering operator escalation. The OODA cycle completes constraint analysis in 0.2 milliseconds, preserving 80\% autonomous coverage while correctly deferring the infeasible task to human judgment---demonstrating that mid-air cargo transfer remains impossible, constraining reallocation to base station cargo swaps. Priority schemes emphasize time-sensitive or high-value packages, accepting degradation in routine deliveries when capacity limitations preclude full compensation.

These scenario variations demonstrate architectural flexibility through consistent OODA mechanics with mission-specific constraint emphasis and priority schemes, validating the architecture's applicability across diverse operational domains while maintaining systematic fault response capabilities.

\section{Priority-Based Task Scoring Algorithm}

Task reallocation following UAV failure constitutes a resource-constrained scheduling problem under uncertainty, wherein orphaned tasks must be systematically evaluated to determine allocation precedence. This evaluation reconciles three potentially competing objectives: temporal urgency imposed by mission deadlines, intrinsic task criticality derived from domain-specific requirements, and the resource expenditure necessary to execute reallocation. Algorithm~1 formalizes this multi-objective prioritization through a weighted scoring function that synthesizes these dimensions into a unified, comparable metric.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{12cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Algorithm 1: Task Priority Calculation} \\
\hline
\textbf{Input:} Task $t_i$ with position, type, and deadline; fleet state $\mathcal{F}$; mission context $\mathcal{M}$ \\
\textbf{Output:} Priority score $P_i \in [0, 1]$ \\[6pt]
\textbf{1.} Compute temporal urgency: $\tau \gets 1 - \dfrac{t_i.\text{deadline} - t_{\text{now}}}{t_i.\text{deadline} - t_i.\text{start}}$ \\[6pt]
\textbf{2.} Look up mission criticality weight: $c \gets W_{\mathcal{M}.\text{type}}[t_i.\text{type}]$ \\[6pt]
\textbf{3.} Find minimum distance to healthy UAV: $d_{\min} \gets \min_{u \in \mathcal{F}.\text{healthy}} \| u.\text{pos} - t_i.\text{pos} \|$ \\[6pt]
\textbf{4.} Normalize spatial cost: $\sigma \gets d_{\min} \,/\, R_{\max}$ \\[6pt]
\textbf{5.} Combine components: $P_i \gets w_\tau \cdot \text{clamp}(\tau) + w_c \cdot c - w_\sigma \cdot \text{clamp}(\sigma)$ \\[6pt]
\textbf{6.} \textbf{return} $\text{clamp}(P_i, 0, 1)$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Each component of the scoring function addresses a distinct aspect of the prioritization problem. The temporal urgency term $\tau$ increases monotonically as deadlines approach, ensuring time-critical objectives receive elevated priority. The mission criticality weight $c$ encodes domain-specific importance hierarchies---critical packages receive maximum weighting (1.0) in delivery missions while routine packages score 0.4; in search and rescue, high-probability victim zones supersede peripheral patrols. The spatial cost term $\sigma$ penalizes tasks distant from available UAVs, implicitly incorporating battery expenditure into the priority calculus.

The default weight configuration ($w_\tau = 0.3$, $w_c = 0.5$, $w_\sigma = 0.2$) emphasizes mission criticality as the primary determinant while maintaining responsiveness to temporal constraints; these parameters admit mission-specific customization as detailed in Section~3.5. This formulation extends auction-based allocation methods (CHOI; BRUNET; HOW, 2009) and utility-theoretic coordination (DIAS et al., 2006; ZLOT; STENTZ, 2006), with the principal distinction being the explicit integration of resource costs within the priority calculus rather than their treatment as post-hoc constraints. The theoretical foundations derive from the ST-SR-IA problem class in Gerkey and Matarić's (2004) taxonomy of multi-robot task allocation.

\section{Constraint-Aware Task Reallocation with Collision Avoidance}

With tasks ranked by Algorithm~1, the subsequent challenge involves constructing feasible assignments to the operational fleet while satisfying interdependent constraints. This task allocation problem constitutes an instance of the generalized assignment problem, known to be NP-hard, rendering exact optimization computationally intractable for real-time fault recovery where decision latency directly impacts mission outcomes.

Algorithm~2 resolves this complexity-feasibility tension through a greedy strategy that processes tasks in descending priority order, assigning each to the nearest constraint-satisfying UAV. This approach guarantees constraint satisfaction by construction while achieving deterministic polynomial-time execution---a trade-off justified by the temporal criticality of fault recovery, where a promptly executed suboptimal allocation provides greater operational value than an optimal solution computed after deadlines have elapsed.

\textbf{6.} \textbf{return} $\mathcal{A}$, coverage, $\textsc{GenerateAlerts}(\mathcal{T}_{\text{unalloc}})$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The algorithm enforces constraints through a hierarchical validation pipeline. Battery constraints constitute the primary filter, verifying that candidates retain sufficient energy to reach the task location while maintaining the 20\% safety margin that accounts for environmental uncertainties such as headwinds and navigation deviations. Payload constraints, activated exclusively in delivery contexts, ensure adequate lift capacity for specified cargo. Collision avoidance, delegated to Algorithm~3, evaluates spatiotemporal compatibility between proposed and committed trajectories.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Algorithm~3 implements spatiotemporal conflict detection derived from velocity obstacle methods (VAN DEN BERG; LIN; MANOCHA, 2008), simplified for centralized planning where global path information obviates distributed negotiation. Conflicts arise when trajectories bring UAVs within 15 meters---approximately three wingspans---during overlapping time windows, reflecting conservative separation standards for low-altitude operations. Upon conflict detection, the candidate assignment is rejected and the next-nearest UAV evaluated; when no conflict-free assignment exists, temporal deconfliction through departure delay scheduling provides an alternative resolution.

\section{Operator Escalation Decision Rules}

A distinguishing feature of this architecture is its capacity for honest self-assessment. Rather than forcing autonomous solutions in all circumstances, the system explicitly recognizes when human judgment is required. Algorithm~4 encodes the escalation logic as a hierarchical decision tree that evaluates mission degradation severity.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{12cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Algorithm 4: Operator Escalation Decision} \\
\hline
\textbf{Input:} Coverage percentage $\rho$; unallocated tasks $\mathcal{T}_{\text{unalloc}}$ with priorities \\
\textbf{Output:} Escalation decision with urgency level and recommendation \\[6pt]
\textbf{1.} \textbf{if} $\rho < 50\%$ \textbf{then} \\
\quad \textbf{return} (escalate=\textsc{True}, urgency=\textsc{High}, \\
\quad\quad reason=``Coverage below 50\% threshold'', \\
\quad\quad recommendation=``Deploy backup UAV or abort mission'') \\[4pt]
\textbf{2.} $n_{\text{critical}} \gets |\{t \in \mathcal{T}_{\text{unalloc}} : P_t > 0.7\}|$ \\
\quad \textbf{if} $n_{\text{critical}} > 0$ \textbf{then} \\
\quad \textbf{return} (escalate=\textsc{True}, urgency=\textsc{High}, \\
\quad\quad reason=``$n_{\text{critical}}$ critical tasks unassignable'', \\
\quad\quad recommendation=``Manual prioritization required'') \\[4pt]
\textbf{3.} \textbf{if} $\rho < 75\%$ \textbf{then} \\
\quad \textbf{return} (escalate=\textsc{True}, urgency=\textsc{Medium}, \\
\quad\quad reason=``Moderate degradation (50--75\% coverage)'', \\
\quad\quad recommendation=``Monitor; consider manual reallocation'') \\[4pt]
\textbf{4.} \textbf{return} (escalate=\textsc{False}, urgency=\textsc{Low}, \\
\quad reason=``Acceptable autonomous compensation ($>$75\%)'', \\
\quad recommendation=``Continue autonomous operation'') \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The escalation hierarchy reflects operational risk tolerance. Coverage below 50\% indicates that the failure has exceeded the fleet's compensatory capacity—continuing autonomously would produce unacceptable mission outcomes. The presence of any unallocated high-priority task ($P > 0.7$) similarly triggers immediate escalation, as these tasks represent mission-critical objectives that cannot be sacrificed without explicit human authorization.

Moderate degradation (50--75\% coverage) warrants operator awareness without demanding immediate intervention, allowing human judgment to assess whether the degraded outcome remains acceptable for the specific operational context. Above 75\% coverage, the system proceeds autonomously, having demonstrated sufficient capacity to absorb the failure's impact.

This graduated response ensures that operator attention is reserved for genuinely consequential decisions while routine failures are handled without interrupting mission flow.

\section{Objective Function and Optimization Strategy}

The preceding algorithms define \textit{how} tasks are prioritized and allocated, but do not explicitly characterize \textit{what constitutes a good allocation}. This section formalizes the objective function that guides the DECIDE phase and describes the optimization strategy employed to maximize decision quality within real-time constraints.

\subsection{Allocation Quality Metric}

The quality of a task reallocation is quantified through an objective function $J(\mathcal{A})$ that the optimizer seeks to maximize. Given an allocation $\mathcal{A} = \{(t_i, u_j)\}$ mapping failed tasks $t_i$ to healthy UAVs $u_j$, the objective function is defined as:

\begin{equation}
J(\mathcal{A}) = \sum_{(t_i, u_j) \in \mathcal{A}} \left[ P_i \cdot \phi_m(t_i, u_j) \right] - \lambda \cdot |\mathcal{T}_{\text{unalloc}}|
\label{eq:objective}
\end{equation}

\noindent where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $P_i \in [0,1]$ is the priority score of task $t_i$ computed by Algorithm 1
\item $\phi_m(t_i, u_j) \in [0,1]$ is a mission-specific modifier function
\item $\lambda > 0$ is the penalty weight for unallocated tasks
\item $|\mathcal{T}_{\text{unalloc}}|$ is the count of tasks that could not be feasibly assigned
\end{itemize}

The mission-specific modifier $\phi_m$ adjusts task value based on operational context:

\begin{equation}
\phi_m(t_i, u_j) =
\begin{cases}
1 - \gamma \cdot \Delta t_{\text{gap}}(t_i) & \text{if } m = \text{surveillance} \\[6pt]
1 + \beta \cdot \dfrac{t_{\text{golden}} - t_{\text{completion}}(t_i, u_j)}{t_{\text{golden}}} & \text{if } m = \text{SAR} \\[6pt]
\begin{cases}
1.0 & \text{if } t_{\text{completion}} \leq t_{\text{deadline}} \\
0.5 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} & \text{if } m = \text{delivery}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:modifier}
\end{equation}

For surveillance missions, the modifier penalizes coverage gaps through parameter $\gamma$, where $\Delta t_{\text{gap}}$ represents the time since last coverage of the task's zone. For search and rescue operations, tasks completed before the golden hour receive a bonus weighted by $\beta$, incentivizing rapid coverage of high-probability areas. For delivery missions, the modifier applies a binary penalty for deadline violations, reflecting the discrete nature of delivery success.

\subsection{Optimization Strategy}

The DECIDE phase operates under strict temporal constraints (1.0--1.5 seconds), precluding exact optimization methods such as mixed-integer linear programming. The system therefore employs a two-stage optimization strategy that balances solution quality against computational tractability.

\textbf{Stage 1: Greedy Initialization.} Algorithm 2 generates an initial feasible allocation in $O(n \cdot m)$ time, where $n$ is the number of failed tasks and $m$ is the number of healthy UAVs. This greedy approach processes tasks in priority order, assigning each to the nearest constraint-satisfying UAV. While not globally optimal, this initialization typically achieves 70--85\% of the theoretical maximum objective value.

\textbf{Stage 2: Local Search Refinement.} When the time budget permits (approximately 500ms remaining after Stage 1), the system applies iterative local search to improve the initial allocation. The neighborhood structure considers pairwise task swaps between UAVs and reassignment of individual tasks to alternative vehicles.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{12cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Algorithm 5: Two-Stage Optimization} \\
\hline
\textbf{Input:} Failed tasks $\mathcal{T}$; healthy UAVs $\mathcal{U}$; mission context $\mathcal{M}$; time budget $T_{\max}$ \\
\textbf{Output:} Optimized allocation $\mathcal{A}^*$ with objective score $J^*$ \\[6pt]
\textbf{Stage 1: Greedy Initialization} \\
\textbf{1.} $t_0 \gets \textsc{CurrentTime}()$ \\
\textbf{2.} $\mathcal{A} \gets \textsc{GreedyAllocate}(\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{U}, \mathcal{M})$ \hfill \textit{// Algorithm 2} \\
\textbf{3.} $J_{\text{best}} \gets \textsc{ComputeObjective}(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{M})$ \\[4pt]
\textbf{Stage 2: Local Search Refinement} \\
\textbf{4.} \textbf{while} $\textsc{CurrentTime}() - t_0 < T_{\max} - T_{\text{reserve}}$ \textbf{do} \\
\quad $\text{improved} \gets \textsc{False}$ \\
\quad \textbf{for each} $(t_1, u_1), (t_2, u_2) \in \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{A}$ where $u_1 \neq u_2$ \textbf{do} \\
\quad\quad $\mathcal{A}' \gets \mathcal{A}$ with swap: $t_1 \to u_2$, $t_2 \to u_1$ \\
\quad\quad \textbf{if} $\textsc{IsFeasible}(\mathcal{A}', \mathcal{M})$ \textbf{then} \\
\quad\quad\quad $J' \gets \textsc{ComputeObjective}(\mathcal{A}', \mathcal{M})$ \\
\quad\quad\quad \textbf{if} $J' > J_{\text{best}}$ \textbf{then} $\mathcal{A} \gets \mathcal{A}'$; $J_{\text{best}} \gets J'$; $\text{improved} \gets \textsc{True}$; \textbf{break} \\
\quad \textbf{if} $\neg\text{improved}$ \textbf{then break} \hfill \textit{// Local optimum reached} \\[4pt]
\textbf{5.} \textbf{return} $\mathcal{A}$, $J_{\text{best}}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The local search explores pairwise task swaps, proposing exchanges between UAVs and accepting improvements that increase the objective function while maintaining constraint feasibility. The algorithm terminates upon reaching a local optimum or exhausting the time budget, whichever occurs first. A 200ms reserve ($T_{\text{reserve}}$) ensures sufficient time for finalization and command dispatch.

\subsection{Optimality Gap Analysis}

The greedy-plus-local-search strategy does not guarantee global optimality. To characterize solution quality, we define the optimality gap as:

\begin{equation}
\text{Gap} = \frac{J^* - J(\mathcal{A}_{\text{heuristic}})}{J^*} \times 100\%
\label{eq:gap}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $J^*$ is the optimal objective value computed offline via exhaustive search or MILP for small problem instances.

Preliminary analysis across the three mission scenarios indicates expected optimality gaps of 5--15\% for typical failure cases involving 3--6 lost tasks and 4--8 healthy UAVs. This trade-off is justified by the real-time constraint: a 10\% suboptimal solution computed in 1.2 seconds provides substantially greater operational value than an optimal solution requiring 30+ seconds, during which mission degradation continues unmitigated.

\subsection{Mission-Specific Parameter Configuration}

The objective function parameters are configured per mission type to reflect operational priorities, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:objective_params}:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Objective Function Parameters by Mission Type}
\label{tab:objective_params}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\rowcolor{gray!30}
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Surveillance} & \textbf{SAR} & \textbf{Delivery} \\
\hline

\rowcolor{gray!15}
Coverage gap weight & $\gamma$ & 0.2 & --- & --- \\

                 & $w_{\text{spatial}}$ & 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This parameterization enables the same OODA loop implementation to adapt its optimization behavior based on mission context, achieving domain-appropriate decision quality without requiring mission-specific algorithmic modifications.

\chapter{Mission Scenarios and Performance Analysis}

This chapter presents three mission scenarios demonstrating OODA-based fault tolerance across diverse operational contexts, each illustrating different constraint priorities, failure modes, and recovery strategies.

\section{Scenario Selection Rationale}

The three scenarios were selected to span the constraint space of real-world UAV operations:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Surveillance:} Battery-constrained with time-critical coverage requirements
\item \textbf{Search \& Rescue:} Time-critical with priority-driven partial coverage acceptance
\item \textbf{Delivery:} Payload-constrained with heterogeneous fleet capabilities
\end{itemize}

Each scenario represents a distinct operational domain with documented real-world deployment precedents.

\section{SCENARIO 1: Long-Duration Perimeter Surveillance}

Perimeter surveillance represents a canonical application of decentralized aerial monitoring, with established methodologies for coordinating multiple UAVs across extended operational periods (BEARD et al., 2006).

\subsection{Mission Context}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Application:} Critical infrastructure monitoring (port, airport, border)
    \item \textbf{Duration:} 2-hour continuous coverage requirement
    \item \textbf{Fleet:} 6 UAVs with 30-minute flight time each (requires rotation strategy)
    \item \textbf{Operational Area:} 120m $\times$ 120m secured perimeter
    \item \textbf{Coverage Strategy:} 9 patrol zones (40m $\times$ 40m each) in a 3$\times$3 grid
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mission Setup}

The surveillance mission partitions the 120m $\times$ 120m area into nine patrol zones (3$\times$3 grid, 40m $\times$ 40m each), ensuring complete coverage while allowing dedicated patrol circuits without inter-vehicle coordination overhead (Figure~\ref{fig:operational_environment}).

The fundamental challenge lies in the mismatch between mission duration (2 hours) and vehicle endurance (30 minutes), necessitating coordinated rotation with at least 12 UAVs in alternating shifts---transforming a simple coverage problem into a sophisticated scheduling and fault-tolerance challenge.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/uav_zone_assignement.png}
\caption{Operational Environment for Experimental Scenarios}
\label{fig:operational_environment}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Patrol Zone Specifications}

Not all perimeter sections demand equal vigilance. The zone prioritization reflects threat assessment based on facility layout and historical incident patterns. The top row (Zones 1--3) along the northern perimeter guards main entry points and receives the highest priority rating ($P = 0.9$), commanding the most intensive patrol patterns. The middle row (Zones 4--6) covers central access routes with moderate priority ($P = 0.6$), while the southern boundary (Zones 7--9) monitors low-risk terrain at standard priority ($P = 0.4$).

This priority differentiation manifests in patrol circuit complexity (ELMALIACH; AGMON; KAMINKA, 2009): high-priority zones require eight waypoints per circuit, medium-priority zones operate with six, and standard-priority zones employ four. Waypoint density directly influences energy expenditure---critical during failure recovery when remaining UAVs must absorb additional coverage responsibilities.

\subsection{Rotation Strategy}

Sustaining 2-hour coverage with 30-minute endurance vehicles requires orchestrated fleet rotation. The system manages this through four consecutive waves, each lasting approximately 30 minutes, with overlapping transition periods to prevent coverage gaps.

The first wave deploys UAVs 1--6 across zones A--F at mission start. As vehicles approach the 20\% battery threshold around the 25-minute mark, they signal imminent departure, triggering deployment of the backup fleet. Wave 2 sees UAVs 7--12 assume patrol responsibilities while the primary fleet returns for battery exchange. This pattern alternates through Waves 3 and 4, with recharged vehicles cycling back into service.

The 5-minute transition overlap provides fault tolerance against timing variations, though this redundancy introduces collision avoidance complexity that the OODA system must manage alongside its primary responsibilities.

\subsection{Failure Scenario: Mid-Mission Battery Depletion}

Forty-five minutes into the mission, UAV-3's battery plummets to 8\% (expected: 35\%)---well below the safety threshold. The vehicle is halfway through Zone 5; returning immediately leaves the zone dark, while continuing risks a forced landing. This is precisely the scenario the OODA system was designed to handle.

\subsubsection{OBSERVE Phase (T+0 to T+1.5s)}

\textbf{Failure Detection:}

The system detects battery anomalies through statistical monitoring, comparing observed discharge rates against expected baseline values. When the discharge rate exceeds 1.5$\times$ the expected threshold, the OODA cycle triggers immediately, as quantified in Table~\ref{tab:s5_anomaly}.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{ORIENT Phase (T+1.5s to T+3.0s)}

\textbf{Impact Assessment:}

The system evaluates the mission impact of losing Zone 5 coverage, determining temporal urgency and required response type (Table~\ref{tab:s5_impact}).

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{8cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Dimension} & \textbf{Assessment} \\

Response Required & Immediate reallocation (0-second tolerance) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Mission Impact Assessment}
\label{tab:s5_impact}
\end{table}

\textbf{Capacity Analysis:}

The system calculates spare battery capacity for each candidate UAV by subtracting safety reserves (20\%) and committed energy from current battery levels, then evaluates feasibility against distance-to-target requirements (Table~\ref{tab:s5_capacity}).

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{UAV} & \textbf{Current} & \textbf{Safety} & \textbf{Committed} & \textbf{Spare} & \textbf{Distance} \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Constraint Feasibility Check}
\label{tab:s5_feasibility}
\end{table}

\textbf{Reallocation Strategy:}

Both adjacent UAVs possess sufficient capacity to reach Zone 5. The system adopts a split-zone strategy to distribute the workload:

\begin{itemize}
\item Split Zone 5 into two sub-zones: 5A (north 20m) and 5B (south 20m)
\item Assign 5A to UAV-2 (adjacent from Zone 2, 40m distance)
\item Assign 5B to UAV-4 (adjacent from Zone 6, 40m distance)
\item Accept reduced waypoint density: 3 waypoints per sub-zone vs. 6 original
\item Coverage degradation: 8.3\% surveillance quality reduction in Zone 5
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{DECIDE Phase (T+3.0s to T+4.5s)}

\textbf{Strategy Selection:} Partial Reallocation (coverage degradation accepted)

\textbf{Task Allocation Plan:}

The system generates extended patrol routes for both UAVs, integrating new waypoints while maintaining constraint satisfaction and collision avoidance (Table~\ref{tab:s5_allocation}).

\begin{table}[H]

\textbf{Constraint Verification:}

Before finalizing the reallocation, the system verifies all safety constraints are satisfied, as detailed in Table~\ref{tab:s5_constraints}.

\begin{table}[H]

\end{table}

\subsubsection{ACT Phase (T+4.5s to T+5.5s)}

\textbf{Command Execution:}

The system dispatches mission updates to affected UAVs and commands the failed vehicle to return immediately, as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:s5_commands}.

\begin{table}[H]

\small
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{6cm}|}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Post-Adaptation Mission Status}
\label{tab:s5_status}
\end{table}

\textbf{Impact Summary:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Zone 5 coverage degraded: 3 waypoints per sub-zone (previously 6)
\item Estimated surveillance quality reduction: 8.3\% in Zone 5 only
\item Overall mission completion: 100\% spatial coverage maintained
\item No operator escalation required
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scenario Outcome}

The OODA system achieved complete coverage recovery in 0.7 milliseconds of computation time while maintaining all safety constraints. Without adaptation, Zone 5 would remain unmonitored for the mission's remainder---an 88.9\% coverage degradation. The sub-millisecond computation ensures that algorithmic processing contributes negligibly to the 2-3 second total system response time (dominated by communication latency).

Two limitations emerge from this scenario. First, merging Zone 5 into adjacent patrol circuits reduces waypoint density, potentially degrading detection probability for that region. Second, the system remains vulnerable to cascading failures; if UAV-2 or UAV-4 experienced subsequent failures, the remaining fleet would lack capacity for full compensation. Beyond two simultaneous failures, manual intervention becomes unavoidable regardless of algorithmic sophistication.

\section{SCENARIO 2: Emergency Search \& Rescue}

\subsection{Mission Context}

Search and rescue operations represent the most time-critical application domain for UAV fault tolerance. The ``golden hour'' principle applies: survival probability decreases precipitously with elapsed time. Every minute of search delay translates directly into reduced likelihood of positive outcome.

This scenario models a missing person search across the same 120m $\times$ 120m area (3$\times$3 grid). A fleet of four UAVs with thermal imaging must cover the area within a 3-hour search window. The zone-based decomposition matches the surveillance scenario's spatial model, enabling consistent constraint validation across mission types.

\subsection{Mission Setup}

Unlike surveillance missions where all zones demand continuous attention, search and rescue prioritization follows probabilistic reasoning. The search grid receives priority assignments based on terrain analysis, the subject's last known position (LKP), and probability-of-area (POA) calculations derived from search theory.

Lost persons do not distribute randomly; behavioral studies indicate predictable patterns (seeking water, following trails, gravitating toward shelter). These priors, combined with distance-decay models from the LKP, concentrate search resources where success is most likely.

\subsection{Search Grid Prioritization}

Algorithm 1's priority scoring adapts to SAR by weighting temporal urgency heavily---the golden hour modifier amplifies scores for zones reachable quickly. The 9-zone grid follows the same priority structure, with zones in three tiers based on distance from the LKP:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{High Priority ($P = 0.9$)}: Zones 1, 2, and 3 (top row, closest to LKP) receive maximum priority based on the statistical observation that most lost persons are found close to their last confirmed location.
\item \textbf{Medium Priority ($P = 0.6$)}: Zones 4, 5, and 6 (middle row) represent probable travel corridors where a mobile subject might move while seeking help or shelter.
\item \textbf{Low Priority ($P = 0.4$)}: Zones 7, 8, and 9 (bottom row, farthest from LKP) cover areas where discovery is less likely but not impossible.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Initial Task Allocation}

\textbf{Fleet Assignment:}

The four-UAV fleet divides the 9-zone search grid according to zone priorities, with higher-priority areas receiving dedicated coverage from individual UAVs to maximize early detection probability (Table~\ref{tab:sar_initial_allocation}).

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{UAV} & \textbf{Assigned Zones} & \textbf{Priority} & \textbf{Est. Time} \\
\hline
UAV-1 & Zones 1, 2 (top-left, top-center) & \cellcolor{red!25}HIGH (0.9) & 8 min \\
UAV-2 & Zones 3, 4 (top-right, mid-left) & \cellcolor{red!25}HIGH/MED (0.9/0.6) & 8 min \\
UAV-3 & Zones 5, 6 (mid-center, mid-right) & \cellcolor{yellow!25}MEDIUM (0.6) & 8 min \\
UAV-4 & Zones 7, 8, 9 (bottom row) & \cellcolor{green!25}LOW (0.4) & 12 min \\
\hline
\multicolumn{4}{|l|}{\textit{Coverage rate: 1 zone per 4 minutes (thermal scan + image capture)}} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Initial Search Grid Allocation by Priority}

% \caption{Search and Rescue Mission OODA Loop}
% \label{fig:sar_loop}
% \end{figure}

\subsection{Failure Scenario: Critical Zone UAV Loss}

Eight minutes into the search, UAV-2 drops off the network. The vehicle had been sweeping Zone 3 (top-right, high priority) and Zone 4 (mid-left, medium priority)---critical areas based on the subject's likely travel patterns from the LKP. Its thermal camera was scanning the zone boundaries where a disoriented hiker might have wandered.

The GPS signal vanished when the drone descended into a narrow ravine, blocked by the terrain that makes this area so dangerous for lost hikers. After 90 seconds without position updates, the failsafe activates: UAV-2 climbs to safe altitude and returns to base, abandoning 2 unsearched zones (Zones 3 and 4) including one high-priority area.

With the golden hour already ticking, these zones represent areas most likely to contain the missing person. The remaining fleet must absorb this loss immediately.

\subsubsection{OODA Cycle Execution}

The OODA cycle for SAR follows the same four-phase structure demonstrated in the surveillance scenario, adapted for time-critical search operations where the golden hour constraint dominates all decisions.

\textbf{OBSERVE (T+0 to T+1.5s):} GPS signal loss triggers UAV-2's autonomous failsafe after exceeding the 90-second timeout threshold. Fleet state aggregation reveals: UAV-1 at 75\% battery completing Zone 2 (20\% spare capacity), UAV-3 at 80\% in Zone 5 (35\% spare), and UAV-4 at 78\% in Zone 7 (30\% spare). The failure leaves 2 zones unsearched (Zones 3 and 4)---one high-priority and one medium-priority area representing critical search regions.

\textbf{ORIENT (T+1.5s to T+3.0s):} Impact assessment quantifies 22\% coverage degradation (2 of 9 zones) with 52 minutes remaining in the golden hour. Capacity analysis confirms the fleet can absorb 2 additional zones: UAV-1 has capacity for 1 more zone, UAV-3 can handle 1 more, and UAV-4 maintains its 3-zone assignment. The system formulates a priority-based strategy: UAV-1 absorbs Zone 3 (high priority, adjacent to current position), UAV-3 absorbs Zone 4 (medium priority, maintains row coverage).

\textbf{DECIDE (T+3.0s to T+4.5s):} Strategy selection yields full reallocation with priority optimization. The reallocation plan expands UAV-1 to 3 zones (Zones 1, 2, 3) and UAV-3 to 3 zones (Zones 4, 5, 6), while UAV-4 continues its 3-zone assignment (Zones 7, 8, 9). Constraint verification confirms all UAVs maintain battery reserves above 20\%: UAV-1 projects 23\% remaining (3\% margin), UAV-3 projects 37\% (17\% margin). Collision avoidance passes with sequential zone entry and 15m safety buffer.

\textbf{ACT (T+4.5s to T+6.0s):} Command dispatch prioritizes golden hour utilization with critical-priority mission updates. Post-adaptation status: 100\% zone coverage recovered (9/9 zones assigned), full spatial coverage maintained---demonstrating that the OODA system achieves complete recovery even in time-critical SAR operations.

\subsection{Scenario Outcome}

The OODA system achieved 100\% zone coverage recovery in 1.2 milliseconds (R5) and 0.3 milliseconds (R6). Both variants maintained zero constraint violations while consuming only 0.00003\% of the golden hour. Without adaptation, coverage would degrade to 77.8\% (7 of 9 zones), leaving 2 critical zones (including one high-priority area) unsearched during the most survivable window.

The millisecond-scale OODA computation ensures fault recovery consumes a negligible fraction of the golden hour, preserving maximum time for actual search operations.

Scenario R6 validates the permission system's flexibility: when optimal reallocation requires UAV-4's out-of-grid capability, the system correctly leverages this permission while respecting each vehicle's authorized operational envelope.

\section{SCENARIO 3: Package Delivery}

\subsection{Mission Context}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Application:} Package delivery to distributed destinations with payload constraints
    \item \textbf{Duration:} 1-hour delivery window
    \item \textbf{Fleet:} 3 UAVs (heterogeneous payload capacities)

    \item \textbf{Delivery Points:} 5 destinations distributed across grid zones
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mission Setup}

\textbf{Fleet Specifications:}

The heterogeneous three-UAV fleet comprises one heavy-lifter and two standard vehicles, each with distinct payload and endurance characteristics, as detailed in Table~\ref{tab:delivery_fleet}.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Package Prioritization by Urgency Level}
\label{tab:delivery_packages}
\end{table}

\subsection{Failure Scenario: Heavy Lifter Battery Anomaly}

Fifteen minutes into the delivery mission, UAV-1 is fighting an unexpected headwind. The heavy lifter is carrying 0.9 kilograms of time-sensitive cargo that must be delivered within the hour. The combination of payload mass and wind resistance is draining its battery nearly twice as fast as planned.

The numbers tell a sobering story: 40\% battery remaining instead of the projected 55\%. At this rate, UAV-1 cannot complete its route and return safely. It carries two critical packages---one destined for Destination 1 (priority 1.0), another for Destination 2 (priority 0.7). One of these deliveries will not happen as planned.

% \begin{figure}[H]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/delivery_loop.png}
% \caption{Delivery Mission OODA Loop}
% \label{fig:delivery_loop}
% \end{figure}

\subsubsection{OODA Cycle Execution}

The delivery scenario demonstrates the OODA system's intelligent escalation capability---recognizing when autonomous recovery is physically impossible and deferring appropriately to human operators.

\textbf{OBSERVE (T+0 to T+1.5s):} Battery anomaly detection triggers when UAV-1's discharge rate (5\%/min) exceeds baseline (3\%/min) by 1.5$\times$. Battery projection analysis reveals the current 40\% charge cannot support the full route: completing Package A delivery to Zone 1 (20m) leaves 38.6\%, but continuing to Package B at Zone 3 (80m additional) and returning to depot (100m) would deplete to 16.6\%---below the 20\% safety threshold. Package A (electronics, priority 1.0) remains deliverable; Package B (components, priority 0.7) becomes infeasible.

\textbf{ORIENT (T+1.5s to T+3.0s):} Fleet capacity analysis reveals no autonomous solution exists. UAV-2 carries 0.45 kg (packages C+D) against 0.5 kg capacity, leaving 0.05 kg spare. UAV-3 carries 0.35 kg (package E), leaving 0.15 kg spare. Neither can absorb Package B's 0.4 kg weight---a 0.25 kg (62.5\%) capacity deficit. The system evaluates alternatives: return-to-base swap (10--15 min, marginal), backup UAV-4 deployment (13 min, recommended), and ground vehicle (20--30 min, deadline violation).

\textbf{DECIDE (T+3.0s to T+4.5s):} Algorithm 4 (Operator Escalation Decision) determines autonomous recovery is infeasible. The decision matrix evaluates: coverage recovery at 80\% (passes >75\% threshold), but one critical task lost (Package B, $P=0.7$) and one constraint violation (payload), as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:delivery_escalation_decision}. The system selects operator escalation with backup UAV recommendation, configuring a 30-second auto-failsafe timer. Autonomous actions proceed immediately: UAV-1 receives modified route (Package A only, then RTL), while UAV-2 and UAV-3 continue unchanged.

\textbf{ACT (T+4.5s to T+5.5s):} The system dispatches mission updates and presents the operator decision interface. The critical alert summarizes: Package B (0.4 kg, $P=0.7$) undeliverable due to payload constraints; recommended action is backup UAV-4 deployment (13 min, meets 45-minute deadline); backup option is ground vehicle (20--30 min, deadline risk). Final system state: operator escalation active, 80\% autonomous coverage preserved, zero constraint violations, safety maintained.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Decision Criterion} & \textbf{Threshold} & \textbf{Status} \\
\hline
Coverage Recovery & >75\% & \cellcolor{green!25}80\% (4/5 packages) \\
Critical Tasks Lost ($P > 0.7$) & 0 & \cellcolor{red!25}1 (Package B) \\

Autonomous Feasibility & TRUE & \cellcolor{red!25}\textbf{FALSE} \\

\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{\textbf{Decision:} Escalate to operator (critical task unrecoverable)} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Operator Escalation Decision Matrix}
\label{tab:delivery_escalation_decision}
\end{table}

\subsection{Scenario Outcome}

The delivery scenarios demonstrate constraint-aware design when physical reality defeats autonomous recovery. In D6, Package B (0.4 kg) exceeds all available spare payload capacity (maximum 0.15 kg); in D7, destination coordinates lie outside the operational grid with no UAV holding out-of-grid permission. The OODA system identified both as autonomously infeasible in 0.2 ms and 0.4 ms respectively, escalating to operators while preserving zero constraint violations.

This outcome inverts the usual success metric. A greedy baseline would report 100\% coverage by overloading UAV-2 to 0.85 kg against 0.5 kg capacity---``success'' that would cause mid-flight failure. The OODA system's 0\% autonomous coverage represents constraint-aware intelligence refusing plans that physics cannot execute. The hybrid approach (80\% autonomous, 20\% supervised) proves more deployable than systems claiming full autonomy while ignoring physical constraints.

\section{Cross-Scenario Comparative Analysis}

Table~\ref{tab:scenario_performance} synthesizes performance metrics across all three mission types, enabling direct comparison of OODA behavior under different operational constraints.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Measured Performance by Scenario}
\label{tab:scenario_performance}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Surveillance (S5)} & \textbf{SAR (R5/R6)} & \textbf{Delivery (D6/D7)} \\
\hline
Coverage Recovery & \textbf{100\%} & \textbf{100\%} & \textbf{0\% (escalated)} \\
OODA Time (mean $\pm$ std) & \textbf{0.42 $\pm$ 0.15 ms} & \textbf{0.88 $\pm$ 0.56 / 0.24 $\pm$ 0.15 ms} & \textbf{0.18 $\pm$ 0.21 / 0.10 $\pm$ 0.03 ms} \\
Operator Escalation & 0\% (autonomous) & 0\% (autonomous) & 100\% (correct) \\
Constraint Violations & \textbf{0} (N=30) & \textbf{0} (N=30) & \textbf{0} (N=30) \\
Dominant Constraint & Battery & Time (golden hour) & Payload \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The three scenarios validate consistent OODA behavior across diverse contexts. Surveillance and SAR achieved full autonomous recovery because constraints permitted reallocation within fleet capacity. Delivery scenarios correctly escalated when payload constraints made autonomous recovery physically impossible---demonstrating that intelligent escalation is a feature, not a failure mode.

Statistical validation (N=30 runs per scenario) confirms consistent sub-millisecond computation across all experiments. Mean OODA computation times ranged from 0.10 ms (D7) to 0.88 ms (R5), with 95\% confidence intervals confirming stable performance (e.g., R5: 0.68--1.08 ms CI). Combined with projected communication latency, total end-to-end response of ~2.2 seconds remains well within the 4-6 second design target. Zero constraint violations occurred across all 150 experimental runs (30 runs $\times$ 5 scenarios). The combination of full autonomous recovery in feasible scenarios with appropriate escalation in infeasible cases demonstrates that honest acknowledgment of physical limitations produces deployable systems.

\chapter{Methodology and Experimental Design}

This chapter describes the methodological approach employed to validate the OODA-based fault-tolerant system. Validation employs software-in-the-loop simulation with deterministic failure injection, enabling controlled and reproducible experiments. Performance is assessed through comparative evaluation against baseline strategies across three mission types, with statistical validation (N=30 runs per scenario) ensuring result reliability.

\section{Simulation Environment}

Validating fault-tolerant control systems presents a fundamental challenge: real-world UAV failures are dangerous, expensive, and difficult to reproduce. This research employs software-in-the-loop simulation (SOARES et al., 2025), implementing physically-grounded vehicle dynamics where failures can be injected deterministically and experiments repeated indefinitely.

The simulation framework implements six-degree-of-freedom quaternion dynamics with cascaded PID control. Vehicle parameters represent a generic mid-size quadrotor (1.5 kg mass, 100 Wh battery, 0.5--1.0 kg payload capacity) characteristic of commercial systems. The Quad SimCon codebase (QUAD SIMCON, 2020) serves as the foundational reference, adapted to support multi-vehicle coordination and centralized fault management.

Communication between simulated UAVs and the Ground Control Station employs TCP/IP transport with JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol, mirroring the request-response patterns of real telemetry systems. The GCS server (port 5555) aggregates fleet state at 2 Hz, while a Flask-based web dashboard (port 8085) provides real-time visualization through WebSocket streaming via SocketIO.

The implementation distributes functionality across purpose-specific modules. The OODA engine (\texttt{gcs/ooda\_engine.py}) orchestrates phase timing and state transitions. Fleet monitoring (\texttt{gcs/fleet\_monitor.py}) implements multi-modal failure detection. Constraint validation (\texttt{gcs/constraint\_validator.py}) enforces battery, payload, and collision safety margins. The mission manager (\texttt{gcs/mission\_manager.py}) maintains the task database with assignment tracking, while the objective function module (\texttt{gcs/objective\_function.py}) implements the two-stage optimization strategy. Vehicle dynamics reside in \texttt{uav/simulation.py}, with GCS communication handled by \texttt{uav/client.py}. The complete source is publicly available (EULÁLIO REIS, 2025).

\section{Validation Metrics}

Four primary metrics anchor the validation framework, each with targets derived from operational requirements and baseline human performance.

\textbf{Coverage Recovery} measures the fraction of orphaned tasks successfully reassigned to healthy UAVs:

\begin{equation}
\rho = \frac{|\mathcal{T}_{\text{reallocated}}|}{|\mathcal{T}_{\text{failed}}|} \times 100\%
\label{eq:coverage}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathcal{T}_{\text{failed}}$ denotes tasks originally assigned to the failed UAV and $\mathcal{T}_{\text{reallocated}}$ represents those successfully reassigned. The target threshold is $\rho > 65\%$ for single-UAV failures and $\rho > 50\%$ for simultaneous double failures, reflecting the diminishing fleet capacity available for absorption.

\textbf{Adaptation Time} captures end-to-end system responsiveness from failure detection to command dispatch:

\begin{equation}
T_{\text{adapt}} = T_{\text{ACT\_complete}} - T_{\text{failure\_detected}}
\label{eq:adaptation}
\end{equation}

This interval encompasses the complete OODA cycle plus communication latency. The target $T_{\text{adapt}} < 5$ seconds ensures bounded mission disruption.

\textbf{Battery Efficiency} evaluates how effectively the system exploits available fleet capacity:

\begin{equation}
\eta_{\text{battery}} = \frac{\sum_{u \in \mathcal{U}_{\text{healthy}}} \Delta B_u}{\sum_{u \in \mathcal{U}_{\text{healthy}}} B_{\text{spare},u}} \times 100\%
\label{eq:efficiency}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\Delta B_u$ represents battery consumed by UAV $u$ for reallocation tasks and $B_{\text{spare},u}$ denotes available capacity above the safety reserve. Efficiency below 80\% suggests conservative allocation leaving recoverable tasks unassigned; efficiency approaching 100\% indicates the fleet operated near capacity limits.

\textbf{Mission Completion Rate} provides the aggregate success metric across experimental trials:

\begin{equation}
\xi = \frac{N_{\text{completed}}}{N_{\text{total}}} \times 100\%
\label{eq:completion}
\end{equation}

A mission counts as completed if primary objectives are achieved despite failures, with target $\xi > 90\%$ for single-failure scenarios.

Secondary metrics supplement this primary framework: operator workload measured by escalation frequency per mission, communication bandwidth consumption in kilobytes per second, and decision quality assessed against optimal solutions computed offline via exhaustive search for small problem instances.

\section{Test Scenarios}

The test suite comprises 169 automated cases organized into three hierarchical categories, executable in approximately 0.22 seconds via pytest.

\textbf{Unit tests} (53 cases) validate individual algorithmic components in isolation. Battery management tests verify reserve calculations and discharge rate monitoring. Grid boundary tests confirm spatial constraint enforcement. State machine tests exercise all valid transitions and reject invalid state progressions. Constraint validation tests confirm that battery, payload, and collision checks correctly accept feasible allocations and reject violations. Priority scoring tests verify Algorithm 1's output against hand-calculated expected values across diverse task configurations.

\textbf{Integration tests} (81 cases) exercise subsystem interactions and mission-specific workflows. Surveillance mission tests validate continuous coverage maintenance with rotation scheduling across simulated 2-hour operations. Search and rescue tests verify grid-based coverage patterns with golden hour deadline enforcement, confirming that the system correctly prioritizes time-critical cells. Delivery tests exercise the two-phase pickup-dropoff workflow with payload constraint tracking. Cross-cutting integration tests validate multi-UAV coordination, collision avoidance during concurrent operations, and complete OODA cycle execution from failure injection through recovery confirmation.

\textbf{Regression tests} (15 cases) preserve fixes for defects discovered during development, encoding specific failure modes (constraint boundary edge cases, race conditions, numerical precision issues) to prevent regression.

Five experimental scenarios provide the primary validation evidence presented in Chapter~6. Scenario S5 exercises surveillance mission recovery from single-UAV battery depletion. Scenarios R5 and R6 test search and rescue operations under GPS loss, with R6 introducing an out-of-grid zone requiring operator permission. Scenarios D6 and D7 challenge the delivery mission with payload constraint violations and out-of-grid destinations respectively, validating the intelligent escalation behavior that distinguishes constraint-aware autonomy from naive allocation strategies.

\section{Baseline Comparisons}

Three baseline strategies establish the comparative framework.

\textbf{No Adaptation} represents the null hypothesis: missions proceed with fixed assignments, and UAV failure results in permanent task loss. This baseline establishes the cost of ignoring failures---expected coverage recovery of 0\% with mission degradation proportional to failed assignment load.

\textbf{Greedy Nearest-Neighbor} implements the simplest autonomous reallocation: assign each orphaned task to the nearest UAV without constraint verification. Expected coverage may reach 100\% in unconstrained scenarios, but risks safety violations when assignments exceed vehicle capabilities---plans that appear successful but fail during execution.

\textbf{Hybrid OODA} (this work) combines priority-based allocation with comprehensive constraint validation. The key differentiator is not speed---both approaches complete in milliseconds---but safety: OODA refuses infeasible allocations and escalates appropriately, whereas greedy approaches blindly assign tasks regardless of physical constraints.

\section{Visualization and Logging}

The web dashboard renders fleet state via Flask with WebSocket streaming: UAV positions with color-coded coverage, battery bars at 2 Hz with 20\% reserve marked, OODA timeline with phase timing, and operator alert log. Post-mission analysis generates coverage traces, adaptation time distributions, and battery efficiency heatmaps, all JSON exportable.

\subsection{Detailed Performance Metrics}

The measured OODA adaptation timings reveal performance characteristics that substantially exceed initial design expectations, as quantified in Figure~\ref{fig:ch6_time}. The surveillance scenario (S5) completed its entire OODA cycle in 0.7 milliseconds, achieving a response 7,000 times faster than the conservative five-second target established during system design. Search and rescue operations demonstrated comparable efficiency, with scenario R5 completing in 1.2 milliseconds and the out-of-grid variant R6 achieving the fastest measured response at 0.3 milliseconds. Even the delivery scenarios requiring constraint violation detection and operator escalation (D6 and D7) completed their analysis in 0.2 and 0.4 milliseconds respectively, demonstrating that safety-critical constraint checking imposes negligible computational overhead.

Coverage recovery patterns across mission types illuminate the system's adaptive capabilities under realistic constraints. Both surveillance and search-and-rescue missions achieved complete 100\% task recovery following single-UAV failures, substantially exceeding the 75-95\% target range established during design. This outcome validates the priority-based reallocation strategy's effectiveness when sufficient spare capacity exists within the operational fleet. The delivery scenarios presented a contrasting yet equally important result: zero percent autonomous reallocation accompanied by intelligent escalation to human operators. This apparent absence of autonomous recovery represents not system failure but rather successful constraint violation detection---the system correctly identified physically infeasible reallocations and appropriately deferred to human judgment rather than compromising safety boundaries.

The computational performance proves particularly striking when examined against design targets. While the initial system specification anticipated 4-6 second OODA cycle times, measured performance of 0.2 to 1.2 milliseconds exceeds this target by nearly four orders of magnitude. This margin ensures that algorithmic computation never becomes the system bottleneck, even under adverse conditions or with larger fleet sizes. For time-critical search and rescue operations conducted under golden-hour constraints, sub-millisecond fault recovery preserves maximum mission time for actual search operations.

Safety validation across all experimental scenarios demonstrates perfect constraint adherence, as summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:ch6_safety} and detailed in Tables~\ref{tab:coverage_matrix} and~\ref{tab:safety_violations}. The OODA system maintained zero constraint violations throughout all five test scenarios, respecting battery reserves, payload limits, and operational boundaries without exception. In stark contrast, the greedy baseline algorithm---which prioritizes coverage maximization without explicit constraint verification---produced two distinct safety violations: a payload overload in scenario D6 where package weight exceeded available capacity, and a boundary transgression in scenario D7 where destination coordinates fell outside permitted flight zones. This comparison reinforces the core value proposition: OODA achieves equivalent speed to greedy approaches while guaranteeing constraint satisfaction.

\section{Experimental Scenario Analysis}

\subsection{S5: Surveillance Mission Recovery}

The surveillance scenario (S5) evaluated system response to a single UAV failure during sustained perimeter monitoring operations. This experiment compared three distinct operational strategies to isolate the contribution of constraint-aware adaptive planning. The no-adaptation baseline, which simply aborted affected tasks without reallocation, achieved only 88.9\% coverage---effectively declaring mission failure upon detecting the fault. The greedy nearest-neighbor heuristic recovered full 100\% coverage in 1.5 milliseconds by assigning orphaned tasks to the spatially nearest available vehicles, though this approach succeeded only because the particular failure configuration happened not to violate capacity constraints.

The OODA system achieved 100\% coverage recovery in 0.7 milliseconds while maintaining perfect safety through explicit constraint verification at each allocation step. This computation time, nearly four orders of magnitude faster than the 4-6 second design target, transforms fault recovery into an essentially instantaneous adaptation invisible to mission progress. More significantly, the OODA approach guaranteed constraint satisfaction through sequential battery, payload, and collision verification, ensuring that the recovered mission plan remained executable rather than merely optimal on paper. All battery reserves remained above the 20\% safety threshold, spatial separation exceeded the 15-meter minimum, and no vehicle received task assignments beyond its physical capabilities. Figure~\ref{fig:surveillance_trajectory} visualizes the pre- and post-failure trajectories, illustrating how the system seamlessly redistributes patrol responsibilities while preserving continuous area coverage.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{images/surveillance_dashboard.png}
\caption{Surveillance Mission Dashboard (S5)}
\label{fig:surveillance_trajectory}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:surveillance_trajectory}, the dashboard provides a real-time visualization of the five-UAV fleet conducting zone-bounded perimeter monitoring. The interface displays individual UAV trajectories, current positions, and zone assignments following dynamic workload reallocation after vehicle failure detection.

\subsection{R5 \& R6: Search \& Rescue with Time Criticality}

The search and rescue scenarios (R5 and R6) examined system performance under the most stringent temporal constraints encountered in civilian UAV operations: the sixty-minute golden hour during which victim survival probability remains highest. Scenario R5 simulated a standard UAV failure during systematic grid search operations, where the no-adaptation baseline abandoned 22.2\% of the search area (2 of 9 zones)---effectively leaving critical zones including one high-priority area unsearched and potentially condemning an injured person to prolonged exposure. The OODA system recovered complete 100\% coverage in 1.2 milliseconds, consuming a negligible 0.00003\% of the precious golden hour interval, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ch6_golden_hour}. In scenarios where every second directly correlates with survival probability, minimizing fault recovery overhead ensures maximum time remains available for actual search operations.

Scenario R6 introduced an additional complexity by positioning one high-priority search zone ten meters outside the nominal 120m $\times$ 120m operational grid boundaries. This configuration tested the system's regulatory compliance mechanisms: could it correctly identify permitted vehicles for out-of-bounds operations while refusing allocation to unauthorized units? The experiment validated this capability comprehensively. With UAV-4 having received explicit out-of-grid authorization from the operator prior to mission commencement, the OODA system correctly reallocated the exterior zone to this permitted vehicle while excluding unauthorized units from consideration. The decision completed in 0.3 milliseconds---the fastest measured across all experimental scenarios---demonstrating that permission verification and regulatory constraint checking impose minimal computational burden. This result confirms that safety-first design principles need not compromise response speed when implemented through efficient data structures and sequential constraint evaluation. Figure~\ref{fig:sar_trajectory} depicts the zone-based search pattern and priority-driven reallocation that ensures complete coverage of high-probability areas within the golden hour window.

Asset detection states are color-coded: yellow denotes active detection by UAV-4, green indicates confirmed identification by UAV-3, and red marks an unconfirmed asset located outside the defined search boundaries. UAV-5 remains positioned at the grid perimeter, awaiting operator authorization to extend beyond the initially specified operational area.

\end{figure}

\subsection{D6 \& D7: Delivery with Intelligent Escalation}

The delivery scenarios (D6 and D7) presented perhaps the most philosophically significant experimental results by validating the system's capacity to recognize its own limitations and appropriately defer to human judgment. Scenario D6 configured a deliberately infeasible task reallocation: following primary delivery vehicle failure, the stranded Package B weighed 0.4 kilograms while the maximum spare payload capacity across all operational vehicles reached only 0.15 kilograms. This represents a fundamental physical impossibility---no combination of available resources could legally transport the package without exceeding structural load limits, as geometrically illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ch6_constraint}.

The contrasting responses across different approaches illuminate critical distinctions in system design philosophy. The greedy baseline algorithm reported 100\% coverage recovery by simply assigning the package to the nearest available vehicle, producing a mission plan that would overload the selected UAV by nearly three times its spare capacity---a configuration guaranteed to cause either structural damage or flight instability. The OODA system correctly identified the infeasibility, completing constraint analysis in 0.2 milliseconds before escalating to operator intervention with explicit explanation: "Package B (0.4 kg) exceeds maximum available spare capacity (0.15 kg). Recommend backup UAV deployment or ground vehicle dispatch."

Scenario D7 examined boundary constraint violations by positioning a delivery destination at coordinates (150, 100) meters---well outside the authorized 120m $\times$ 120m operational grid. Unlike scenario R6 where a permitted vehicle existed for out-of-bounds operations, no UAV in scenario D7 carried the necessary authorization. The greedy algorithm again reported perfect coverage while violating the spatial boundary constraint. The OODA system refused this unsafe allocation, completing analysis in 0.4 milliseconds before escalating with regulatory justification: "Destination outside authorized flight zone. No vehicle possesses out-of-grid permission. Operator intervention required for boundary waiver or mission modification."

These results validate a crucial principle often overlooked in autonomous systems research: intelligent refusal represents successful operation, not system failure. The OODA system's zero percent autonomous reallocation in physically or regulatorily infeasible scenarios demonstrates correct constraint detection and appropriate escalation rather than algorithmic inadequacy. A system that claims 100\% autonomy by violating safety constraints provides less operational value than one that achieves 60\% autonomous coverage while correctly identifying when human judgment becomes necessary. This honest acknowledgment of limitations distinguishes deployable systems from theoretical frameworks that assume constraints away. Figure~\ref{fig:delivery_trajectory} illustrates this intelligent escalation behavior, showing how deliverable tasks proceed while physically infeasible assignments trigger operator alerts with recommended actions.

Figure~\ref{fig:delivery_trajectory} presents the point-to-point delivery route visualization. UAV-2 (blue, loaded) approaches the designated drop-off location, while UAV-3 proceeds toward an out-of-bounds pick-up position following explicit operator authorization. UAV-4 has reached the operational boundary, triggering an escalation request for operator permission. The dashboard interface displays real-time fleet status alongside the active operator alert requiring human intervention.

Tables~\ref{tab:approach_comparison} and~\ref{tab:tradeoffs} synthesize these findings into a comprehensive comparison framework. Four patterns emerge from this data. First, computational speed remains uniformly under 1.5 milliseconds across all mission types, validating the greedy heuristic approach over optimization algorithms with unpredictable execution times. Second, zero constraint violations occurred despite widely varying failure conditions---a perfect safety record that distinguishes this approach from opportunistic algorithms. Third, the system demonstrates selective autonomy: aggressive adaptation when feasible (surveillance, SAR), intelligent refusal when infeasible (delivery). Fourth, sub-millisecond response times ensure fault recovery never becomes a mission bottleneck.

\subsection{Claims Validated}

The experimental program validated all primary thesis claims:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Rapid adaptation:} Statistical validation (N=30) confirms mean computation times of 0.10--0.88 ms for OODA cycles, ensuring algorithmic processing contributes negligibly to the 2-3 second projected end-to-end response (well within the 4-6 second design target)
\item \textbf{Safety guarantee:} Zero constraint violations across all 150 experimental runs (battery, payload, spatial boundaries)
\item \textbf{Intelligent escalation:} D6 and D7 correctly refused infeasible reallocations rather than producing unsafe plans
\item \textbf{Coverage recovery:} 100\% task recovery in surveillance and SAR missions, matching greedy baseline while maintaining safety
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Contributions}

The work advances three contributions. First, a \textbf{unified constraint verification framework} that simultaneously enforces battery reserves, payload limits, and temporal deadlines through fail-fast sequential checking---the first multi-UAV fault tolerance system to address all three constraint categories together. Second, a \textbf{quantified degradation framework} with explicit decision rules governing when autonomous reallocation transitions from feasible to infeasible, enabling honest acknowledgment of system limitations rather than claiming universal fault tolerance. Third, a \textbf{hybrid autonomy architecture} that balances machine speed with human oversight, enabling deployment under current BVLOS regulations that require operator-in-the-loop supervision.

Beyond algorithmic innovation, the research delivers practical value: compatibility with commercial UAV platforms, autonomous recovery in three of five scenarios (S5, R5, R6) with appropriate escalation in the remaining two, and a comprehensive test suite (169 tests, 0.22s execution) enabling rapid validation. The open-source simulation platform provides infrastructure for future research without requiring physical hardware.

The philosophical contribution may prove most significant: demonstrating that realism-first design---explicitly modeling constraints rather than abstracting them away---produces systems that are both academically rigorous and operationally deployable.

\chapter{Limitations and Future Work}

This chapter examines current limitations and future research directions for the OODA-based fault-tolerant control system.

\section{Architectural Constraints}

\subsection{Centralized Control Architecture}

The system employs a centralized Ground Control Station for OODA loop execution, creating a single point of failure. Should the GCS experience hardware failure or communication loss, the fleet's adaptive capabilities are compromised. Individual UAVs implement autonomous Return-to-Launch protocols upon GCS timeout detection, preserving vehicle safety while sacrificing mission completion.

Distributed OODA architectures using consensus algorithms (IZADI; GORDON; ZHANG, 2013) could eliminate this vulnerability while introducing communication complexity, network partitioning risks, and Byzantine fault tolerance requirements.

\subsection{Fleet Scalability}

The system supports fleets of three to twelve UAVs. Beyond this scale, two constraints become significant. Communication bandwidth scales linearly with fleet size, reaching 48 kilobytes per second for twelve UAVs at 2 Hz telemetry rates. Computational complexity for collision avoidance scales quadratically, as each reallocation requires pairwise verification among all vehicles. At twenty UAVs, collision checking workload increases 2.8-fold compared to twelve UAVs, potentially exceeding the six-second OODA cycle target.

Hierarchical architectures partitioning large fleets into coordinated subgroups, or spatial hashing for approximate collision avoidance, could enable coordination of dozens or hundreds of vehicles.

\subsection{Validation Approach and Limitations}

\subsubsection{Experimental Methodology}

Validation employs a software-in-the-loop simulation framework with deterministic failure injection, enabling controlled and reproducible experiments. The methodology proceeds in four stages:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Scenario Definition:} Each experiment specifies mission type (surveillance, SAR, delivery), fleet size, task distribution, and failure events with precise timing and affected UAVs.

\item \textbf{Baseline Comparison:} Three strategies are evaluated under identical conditions: (a) \textit{No Adaptation}---tasks remain assigned to failed UAVs, establishing coverage loss baseline; (b) \textit{Greedy Nearest}---assigns orphaned tasks to nearest capable UAV without pre-validation, measuring constraint violation frequency; (c) \textit{OODA}---the proposed constraint-aware approach with pre-allocation validation.

\item \textbf{Statistical Validation:} Each scenario executes N=30 independent runs to establish statistical significance. Results report mean $\pm$ standard deviation with 95\% confidence intervals, ensuring reproducibility claims are quantified rather than anecdotal.

\item \textbf{Metrics Collection:} Coverage recovery percentage, OODA computation time, constraint violations, and escalation events are recorded per run and aggregated across the statistical ensemble.
\end{enumerate}

This methodology isolates the contribution of constraint-aware decision-making by holding environmental variables constant while varying only the reallocation strategy.

\subsubsection{Simulation Limitations}

Current validation relies exclusively on software-in-the-loop simulation using physics-based models representative of mid-size commercial quadrotors. While appropriate for algorithm development, simulation abstracts real-world phenomena including GPS multipath errors, communication packet corruption, sensor noise, and environmental disturbances.

Hardware-in-the-loop testing with physical flight controllers would capture timing constraints and communication latencies. Field trials with two to three UAVs would expose the system to genuine environmental challenges, establishing the operational envelope for reliable performance.

\section{Algorithmic Limitations}

\subsection{Greedy Task Reallocation}

The constraint-aware reallocation algorithm employs a greedy heuristic that assigns tasks to the nearest UAV satisfying capacity constraints. This achieves rapid execution compatible with real-time OODA requirements but does not guarantee globally optimal allocation. Early assignment decisions may consume capacity better reserved for higher-priority tasks, particularly when spare capacity is marginal and failed tasks are widely distributed.

Mixed-integer linear programming could guarantee optimal solutions though solution times may exceed OODA cycle budgets. Auction-based algorithms, particularly the Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm, offer near-optimal solutions through distributed iterative bidding with polynomial-time complexity.

\subsection{Simplified Collision Avoidance}

The collision avoidance strategy maintains fifteen-meter spatial separation with temporal deconfliction when conflicts arise. This proves sufficient for sparse operational densities but exhibits limitations in dense flight patterns. The fixed safety buffer does not adapt to relative velocities, and the pairwise verification approach does not efficiently handle complex multi-vehicle conflicts.

Velocity obstacle approaches (Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles) and model predictive control formulations could extend applicability to urban air mobility scenarios with higher flight densities.

\section{Application Scope}

The system addresses three mission classes: long-duration surveillance, emergency search and rescue, and priority-based delivery. These applications share waypoint-based navigation, quantifiable task priorities, and tolerance for mission degradation under resource constraints.

However, this focused scope excludes mission types with different requirements. Aggressive formation flying demands tighter coordination and higher-bandwidth communication than the current 2 Hz telemetry supports. Adversarial scenarios require game-theoretic reasoning and adversarial prediction beyond current OODA capabilities. Time-critical interception missions may need more sophisticated trajectory optimization than waypoint following provides.

Extending to these domains could involve augmented OODA loops for formation flying or game-theoretic task allocation for adversarial scenarios, broadening applicability while preserving core OODA principles.

\section{Future Research Directions}

\textbf{Near-term enhancements} include validation across all twenty-seven planned scenarios, sensitivity analysis of safety reserves (5--20\% battery), and environmental modeling incorporating turbulence effects.

\textbf{Medium-term objectives} encompass hardware-in-the-loop testing via PX4 SITL, field demonstrations revealing GPS and RF interference challenges, and distributed OODA architectures with consensus-based decision-making. Auction mechanisms such as the Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm require attention to Byzantine fault tolerance. Formal verification using model checking and temporal logic could guarantee constraint satisfaction and liveness properties.

\textbf{Long-term frontiers} involve machine learning for priority optimization---neural networks for battery prediction, reinforcement learning for adaptive OODA tuning---and game-theoretic analysis for adversarial scenarios (Stackelberg formulations, Nash equilibria). Fleet heterogeneity with mixed vehicle capabilities and swarm coordination for fleets exceeding fifty vehicles demand hierarchical architectures and allocation strategies exploiting complementary strengths.

\section{Concluding Perspective}

The limitations discussed reflect conscious design choices prioritizing practical deployability over theoretical completeness. The centralized architecture enables regulatory compliance and deterministic performance. The greedy allocation strategy trades global optimality for real-time responsiveness. The constraint-aware approach acknowledges physical limitations rather than assuming unlimited resources.

A system achieving 65--95\% autonomous coverage recovery within realistic bounds provides more value than theoretical frameworks promising perfect adaptation under idealized assumptions. The identified future work charts a path toward enhanced capabilities while maintaining honest, deployable autonomy.

As multi-agent UAV coordination matures, the research community must prioritize systems bridging the gap between laboratory demonstration and operational deployment. This requires explicit modeling of real-world constraints, acknowledgment of fundamental limitations, and design of hybrid human-machine systems leveraging complementary strengths of autonomous algorithms and human supervisory control. The present work contributes to this maturation by demonstrating that constraint-aware, operator-supervised fault tolerance represents the appropriate architecture for near-term UAV fleet deployments in regulated, safety-critical applications.

\chapter{Conclusion}

This work addresses the reality gap in multi-agent UAV fault tolerance by explicitly modeling real-world constraints (battery, payload, regulatory) that are often ignored in academic research. Rather than claiming perfect fault tolerance, the hybrid OODA approach provides honest, quantified mission completion assistance within realistic operational limits.

\textbf{Validated performance meets design targets.} Statistical validation (N=30 runs per scenario) demonstrates mean computation times of 0.10--0.88 milliseconds for complete OODA cycles, with 95\% confidence intervals confirming consistent sub-millisecond algorithmic performance. Combined with projected communication latency (~2 seconds), the end-to-end system response of approximately 2.2 seconds falls well within the conservative 4--6 second design target. Experimental validation across 169 automated tests and 150 statistical runs confirms complete coverage recovery for surveillance and search-and-rescue missions, while delivery scenarios correctly escalate to operators when payload or boundary limitations preclude autonomous reallocation. Zero safety violations occurred across all experimental runs.

\textbf{Key insight:} Selective autonomy---aggressive adaptation when feasible, intelligent refusal when infeasible---proves more valuable than unconstrained systems that risk safety violations. In time-critical search-and-rescue operations, sub-millisecond fault recovery ensures that adaptation overhead remains negligible relative to mission duration, preserving maximum time for actual search operations during the golden hour.

The three core technical contributions---resource-aware reallocation, priority-based partial coverage, and operator escalation---work together to balance autonomous response speed with human oversight, making this approach suitable for deployment under current regulations. The comprehensive test suite (169 tests executing in 0.22 seconds) provides confidence in system reliability while enabling rapid development iteration.

\textbf{Acknowledged limitations.} These results must be interpreted within the system's design constraints. The centralized GCS architecture creates a single-point vulnerability---though individual UAVs implement autonomous Return-to-Launch upon communication timeout, fleet-level adaptation ceases during GCS failure. The greedy allocation strategy trades global optimality for real-time response, potentially yielding suboptimal task assignments when spare capacity is marginal. Most critically, validation remains exclusively software-in-the-loop without field deployment exposure to GPS multipath errors, RF interference, environmental turbulence, or sensor noise that characterize real-world operations. Hardware-in-the-loop testing and field trials represent essential next steps before operational deployment.

Despite these constraints, the work demonstrates that constraint-aware, operator-supervised fault tolerance represents a practical architecture for near-term UAV fleet deployments in regulated, safety-critical applications. The path forward lies not in claiming unrestricted autonomy, but in designing hybrid systems that explicitly acknowledge physical limits while maximizing autonomous capability within those bounds.
