[flake8]
# --- Core Settings ---

# Set a max line length of 120 (a common standard when using Black)
max-line-length = 120 

# Set the maximum allowed complexity for a function (using the McCabe checker C901)
max-complexity = 10 

# --- Exclusions ---

# Define directories and files that Flake8 should ignore completely.
# This is crucial for fast runtime!
exclude =
    .git,
    __pycache__,
    docs,
    venv,
    .venv,
    migrations/*,
    build/*,
    # If using Django, you might add settings/local.py, etc.

# --- Ignoring/Selecting Specific Rules ---

# Define the error codes to ignore globally. Be selective.
ignore =
    # E501: Line too long (Ignored because we explicitly set max-line-length above, 
    #       but sometimes kept in 'ignore' if a tool like Black handles it)
    E501, 
    # W503: Line break before a binary operator (Ignored because Black puts breaks before operators)
    W503, 
    # E203: Whitespace before ':' (Ignored because Black uses PEP 8's stance on this)
    E203,
    # D100, D104: Missing docstrings (Uncomment to disable docstring checks)
    # D100, D104,

# --- Optional Plugin Settings ---

# If you install the 'pep8-naming' plugin (prefix N), you can customize it:
# You can allow certain non-PEP-8 names here if necessary
# N802: function name should be lowercase
# N806: variable name should be lowercase
# N803: argument name should be lowercase
# N804: first argument to a class method should be named cls
# N805: first argument to a method should be named self
# N815: constants should be uppercase
# N817: variable names must be descriptive
# N818: exception name should end with 'Error'

# If you install the 'flake8-docstrings' plugin (prefix D), you can select a style:
# Style is usually numpy, google, or pep257.
# docstring-convention = numpy
